Oh! Hello. Something something.... words. #line:10000100
My name is ^c:1486b0;$name;^c:pop; by the way! #line:10000200
I'm a human being. #line:10000300
How about you? #line:10000400
You should build me a pizzeria some time because I'm too lazy to do it myself. #line:10000500

Ciao! You must be the new farmer that recently moved to Staxel. #line:10000600
That explains why you got roped into building a house for a complete stranger. #line:10000700
Here, have this pizza themed wall clock as payment for building my home for me. #line:10000800
<<giveItemToPlayer tilePlacer MarkGrant.AngelosPizzeria.tileObject.PizzaWallClock>>
Feel free to stop by any time and start the construction of my pizzeria! #line:10000900
